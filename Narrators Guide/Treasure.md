# Treasure, Loot & Magic Items

The Players and their Characters want Treasure. Sometimes, a specific Magic Item or bit of Loot needs to be called out for plot reasons or because the Players will think it's cool, but more often than not you want something faster than that. Rolling for Treasure is a fast and easy way of creating rewards for Character actions. 

Move this down: Minor monsters and NPCs don't have Treasure, but small bits of Loot which can be rolled for with 1d2, 1d4, 1d6, or 1d8 on the Loot table.

## Treasure

Treasure is the Coin, Magic Items, and other valuable Loot that Player Characters find and appropriate on their journies. To make things easy, it can be expressed in Units.

When creating an area for your Players to explore (either before a game session or on the fly), you can follow some or all of these steps:

First, determine the types of treasure found in the area

* Lots of Treasure?
* Valuable Treasure?
* Magical Treasure?



 simply choose a number of Treasure Units for each room that you want to have Treasure. 

If you need really big piles of loot, roll a d12 and extrapolate the values for  11 and 12.

These tables are suitable for Basic Level Games.

| 1d6  | Type       |
| ---- | ---------- |
| 1-5  | Loot       |
| 6    | Magic Item |

If you need more or less magic items, use a d4 or d8, maybe even a d10 if magic items are really rare.
