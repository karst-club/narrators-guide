# Magic Workshop

We're using a vancian magic system that's based on B/X / BECMI but with ADD1e inspirations 

Magic is broken up into 4 schools, each of which has 1-3 types of magic (from add&d)

This somewhat replaces the Cleric / Magic User / Druid / Illusionist quatro of ADD, but with some differences as each school is a mashup

Deceit includes Illusion/Phantasm and Enchantment/Charm. It is largely a replacement for the illusionist role, but has the interesting effect of taking some of the priestly call to battle spells. The school is largly a sinister one, but could be used for good

Spiritism gets three types of magic, Divination, Abjuration, and Necromancy. This is a definite replacement for the Druid / Cleric / supportive role, consisting of defensive and perceptive spells.

Thaumatury has but one type of magic, Alteration. These spells are some of the most powerful and varied and this school largely replaces the traditional Magic User

Theurgy includes two types of magic, Conjuration and Evocation. The most combat-oriented school of magic, the Theurge is equal parts summoner, holy-warrior, and battle mage.

| School      | Total | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 | Level 5 | Level 6 |
| ------      | ----- | ---     | ---     | ---     | ---     | ---     | ---     |

| Spiritism   | 30    | 6       | 5       | 8       | 3       | 6       | 2       |
| Thaumaturgy | 38    | 4       | 8       | 5       | 8       | 6       | 7       |
| Theurgy     | 16    | 3       | 3       | 3       | 2       | 3       | 2       |
