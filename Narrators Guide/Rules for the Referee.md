# Rolls and Chance

Higher numbers are always better.

The most common type of Roll that your Players will make are Success Rolls. In a Success Roll, there is a Target Number that, if reached or exceeded by the roll, results in a Success rather than a Failure. 

Player Characters roll a d20 To-Hit and Save, and a d6 for most everything else they attempt to do. Often times, you will have to roll the d6 in secrect for them, with or without their knowledge.

Rolling the highest number on the dice is always a success and rolling the lowest number is always a failure. Other results get modified and compared against some kind of target number, AC for attacks, 15 for Saves, and 6 for Actions with a d6.

 A lot of times it should be you rolling a d6 in secret when a player tries to do something sneaky and when you genuinely don't know what the outcome of their actions should be. 

## "Checks"

Karst discourages rolling checks for everything, as it slows things down and pigeonholes characters. Generally speaking, if you have a Knack for something, you should just be able to do that thing. Many Knacks do explicitly improve a Character's Action Roll
