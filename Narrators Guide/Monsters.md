## Fire Beetle

| AC   | HD   | Attack | Move | Morale | Group Size | Treasure |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ---- | ------ | ---------- | -------- |
| 15   | 1+2  | 2d4    | 120' | 7      | 1-8 / 2-12 | -        |

These nocturnal creatures are prized for their glowing nodules, which are used by the islanders to fish. Growing almost a meter in length, adult beetles have three nodules which can be harvested, one above each eye and a slightly larger nodule on its rear abdomen. Properly removed, the nodules retain their glow, illuminating a 10' radius, for 1 to 6 days.

## Crystal Crab Statue

| AC   | HD   | Attack    | Move | Morale | Group Size | Treasure |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | ---- | ------ | ---------- | -------- |
| 14   | 3    | 1d6 / 1d6 | 90'  | 11     | 1-6        | -        |

These hulking crystalline statues have the appearance of some sort of bipedal crabfolk. They stand roughly one and a half times the height of most Folk and are typically motionless, as one would expect a statue to be, but they are clearly capable of movement. Found in small clusters around the island, these groups are known to slowly migrate across the terrain, though few have witnessed them in motion or lived to tell the tale.

## Cult Acolyte

| AC   | HD   | Attack | Move | Morale | Group Size | Treasure |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ---- | ------ | ---------- | -------- |
| 17   | 1    | 1d6    | 60'  | 7      | 1-8 / 1-20 | U        |

Members of the Crab Cult include local natives and those drawn to the island by the pull of the statues. Their primary base of operation is the Cave in the Palms, where they maintain living quarters, a temple, and an active dig site, all while waging a protracted campaign against giant crabs and spiders. They dress in full carapace and crab shell armor when they are away from prying eyes in the cave. Groups may include one or two second or third level Priests versed in Spiritism or Theurgy.

## Hate Sprites

| AC   | HD   | Attack | Move       | Morale | Group Size  | Treasure |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ---------- | ------ | ----------- | -------- |
| 14   | 1/2  | Spells | 60' / 180' | 7      | 3-18 (5-40) | S        |

These little spirits can make people angry and frustrated. They are capable of casting minor curses and incredibly tiny Magic Missiles (1d1), as well as flying. Sprites are immune to certain forms of Deceit, such as Sleep, but can be Banished.

## Skeletons

| AC   | HD   | Attack | Move | Morale | Group Size  | Treasure |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ---- | ------ | ----------- | -------- |
| 12   | 1    | 1d6    | 60'  | 12     | 3-12 (3-30) | -        |

Skeletons are what happens when the mists, dark forces, or some other form of strange magic gets its hold on one or more corpses that have had time to fully say farewell to flesh. Being undead, they are immune to most Deceit, but can be Banished.

Zombies are on the fresher end of the undead spectrum.
